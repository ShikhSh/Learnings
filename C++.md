# C++ Notes
### Important Includes:
- What does #include do?
  - #something -> Directive - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/hash-include-directive-c-cpp?view=msvc-170
  - Tells the preprocessor to include the contents of a specified file at the point where the directive appears.
  - Makes it easier to read, maintain, and modify code.
  - Important Directives:
    - #include <bits/stdc++.h> -> includes most of the important functionalities like:
      - vectors - #include <vector>

## Vectors:
### Iterators:
- vector<int>::iterator it;
- for(it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); it++)
    cout << *it << "\n";
