| 1 | All Possible Full Binary Trees | Remember to iterate for all possible children for left and right subtrees. Rest is simple, just create trees, and store them in a map and check it for dp memorization.| https://leetcode.com/problems/all-possible-full-binary-trees/description/ |
| 2 |0-1 Knapsack | fill the knapsack upto its Weight, choosing max(including, excluding), takes W*N time and memory | https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1152328/01-Knapsack-Problem-and-Dynamic-Programming|
| 3 | 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck - Fill-up truck to get maximum value. | NOT the same as 0-1 Knapsack since all boxes weigh the same, thus picking up with the maximum value is as good as picking up the one with minimum value, hence NO need of dp and simply greedy works | https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/description/ |
